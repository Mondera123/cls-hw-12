For the lovers of desserts--cakes and pastries are no different. For them, these all are spongy, creamy, and flavoursome foods to lick, 
eat, and savour to the core. Though all these are sweet treats meant to satiate the sweet tooths, they differ from each other in terms 
of texture and flavour.
<br>
<br>
Knowing the difference will help you understand your cravings better. Do your taste buds want to taste a whole creamy cake or they are satisfied
with a rectangular piece of pastry. And as a result, you can make a conscious decision whether you want to go for a cake delivery or with a cute box 
of pastries.
<br>
<br>
<i>What is A Cake: A cake is a sweet edible food prepared by mixing flour, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients which is often decorated with icing. Cakes are 
usually eaten on birthdays and anniversaries.</i>
<br>
<br>
<i>What is A Pastry: A pastry is a sweet dessert baked mainly from wheat flour, water, and fat. Fat solids at room temperature are added to make it more 
appealing.</i>
